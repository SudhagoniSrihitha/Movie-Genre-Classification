# 🎬 Movie Genre Classification using Machine Learning

This project focuses on automatically classifying movie genres based on textual features using Machine Learning techniques. It demonstrates the complete pipeline of a basic NLP-based classification task including data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and prediction.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Movie platforms handle large volumes of content, making manual genre tagging inefficient. This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict the genre of a movie based on its description or related textual data.

---

## 🧠 Approach
1. Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization)
2. Feature extraction using TF-IDF / Bag of Words
3. Training a classification model
4. Evaluating model performance
5. Predicting movie genres for new inputs
